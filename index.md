The lofty goal of my project was to map and connect the data of the 100th Regiment of Foot in a public online wiki. After collecting the data, scans of [handwritten documents] (https://github.com/JonahE5/Transcription1/blob/main/NAO_Test.png?raw=true), the focus of this particular project changed to just transcribing the data for future use.

My first attempt at transcription was with Microsoft Azure which got off to a rocky start. You can read about my process to get Azure to work here: [Devlog 3] (https://github.com/JonahE5/MyOwnDigitalHistory/blob/main/Devlog%203.md)

Eventually Jeff B and I were able to get the code working and Azure was able to transcribe my documents.

The two sets of code we fixed can be found here: [Code 1] (https://github.com/JonahE5/MyOwnDigitalHistory/blob/main/Code%201.md) and here: [Code 2] (https://github.com/JonahE5/MyOwnDigitalHistory/blob/main/Code%202.md). Thanks to Alex L for providing the original code.

The [results] (https://github.com/JonahE5/MyOwnDigitalHistory/blob/main/Results.md) of Azure’s transcription were not perfect when compared to the original text.

My back-up plan was to use the [Transkribus] (https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) which is a free program that can be trained to recognize specific handwriting. However it requires 50-75 full pages of pre-transcribed text in order for the system to become familiar. This sounds like it might be useful given that there are 200 pages that need to be transcribed right? Problem: the content I am working with is Regiment rolls; Charts. Neither Azure nor Transkribus recognize well enough to make their transcriptions worth while. The amount of editing required to turn the results into a new digital chart reduces the overall time saved by having a machine do the transcription. Perhaps in another five years the technology will be more accommodating to this project.
